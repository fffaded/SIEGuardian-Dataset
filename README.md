# Dataset

**NPDI Dataset**

The NPDI dataset is a commonly used pornographic video dataset containing a total of 77 hours of video material. It contains 400 pornographic and 400 normal videos covering people from different regions and ethnicities. Normal videos are further subdivided into two categories, easy and difficult. Easy videos are randomly selected from popular video platforms, while difficult videos are obtained by searching for keywords, such as swimming, wrestling, etc.

Due to **copyright** constraints, we are unable to provide the videos directly. All requests for the NPDI dataset must be submitted to Prof. Sandra Avila at [sandra@ic.unicamp.br]().



**Pornography-2k Dataset**

The Pornography-2k dataset expands on the NPDI and contains a total of 140 hours of video material. It contains 1,000 pornographic videos and 1,000 normal videos, with video durations ranging from 6 seconds to 33 minutes. The videos were sourced from comprehensive video platforms (e.g. Youtube) and specialised pornographic video sites. The diversity in terms of type of pornographic content and scenarios is closer to real scenarios.

Due to **copyright** constraints, we are unable to provide the videos directly. All requests for the Pornography-2k dataset must be submitted to Prof. Anderson Rocha  at anderson.rocha@gmail.com.



**NSFW Dataset**

The NSFW dataset consists of 65,000 pornographic images and 37,000 normal images. Pornographic images were collected from legitimate websites, while non-pornographic images were collected through search engines such as baidu and bing. **This dataset is used for research purposes only**.

Due to **copyright and regional legal** constraints, we are unable to provide the dataset directly. All requests for the NSFW dataset must be submitted to David Smith at [fffaded@163.com]().
